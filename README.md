# GMH-Examples.jl
Example experiments for the Generalized Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Calderhead, 2014), showing the GMH functionality of the GeneralizedMetropolisHastings.jl repository. 

The Julia scripts and IJulia Notebooks provided in this repository explain how to use the GMH library to develop new experiments of your own.
